# ePaper_slideshow
Here's an Arduino sketch for the SparkX 3 color ePaper display to cycle through .bmp images on an SD card.

I'm using the [Sparkfun SparkX 1.54" ePaper display: SPX-14892](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/14892)
It's a retired product... but there's a [larger screen](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15013) available that you can use just the same.

I built on examples from the [ePaper library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ePaper_Arduino_Library)

ePaper has a nice visual quality that I like, though the refresh between images is long and janky due to the nature of the ePaper display.
